There was once a programmer name Steve. Steve liked writing small scripts in his free time. One day, 
Steve wanted to learn something new. He decided to learn machine learning. But it turned out that Steve
was already an expert in machine learning! He already knew how to write if-statements, and we all know that
machine learning is just a lot of if-statements.
